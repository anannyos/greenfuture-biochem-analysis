# GreenFuture BioChem Operations Analysis

## Case Study 1 - Data Analytics Senior Seminar

### Project Overview
Analysis of operational inefficiencies for GreenFuture BioChem, a global bio-chemical manufacturer facing 5.1% manufacturing cost overruns.

### Key Findings
- **5.1% cost overrun** ($372,000+ annually) due to flawed cost models
- **92.6% production yield** vs. 95% industry benchmark
- Identified **high-cost, high-emission suppliers**
- **Data integration gap** preventing full margin analysis

### Methodology
- **Data Integration:** 5 datasets (7,400+ rows)
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analysis (r=0.91), variance analysis
- **Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), Tableau
- **Techniques:** Cost modeling, yield analysis, supplier evaluation

### Repository Contents
- `analysis_code.py` - Complete Python analysis code
- `GreenFuture_Analysis_Report.pdf` - 11-page detailed report
- `data/` - Sample datasets (if included)

### Project Impact
**$596.5M projected annual savings** through:
1. Cost model revision
2. Yield improvement programs  
3. Portfolio rationalization
